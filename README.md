# Research Paper Recommendation System

This project explores the design and development of a recommendation system for academic research papers using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **graph-based models**.



## 📄 About the Project

- Built to recommend relevant research papers based on user input and paper metadata.
- Techniques used include:
  - Text vectorization (TF-IDF)
  - Cosine similarity
  - NetworkX for graph construction
- Evaluated various recommendation strategies for effectiveness.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
